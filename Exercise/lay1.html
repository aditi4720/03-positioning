                        Borders fall between the padding and margin, providing an outline around an element. The border property requires three values:
                        width, style, and color. Shorthand values for the border property are stated in that orderâ€”width, style, color. In longhand, these 
                        three values can be broken up into the border-width, border-style, and border-color properties. These longhand properties 
                        are useful for changing, or overwriting, a single border value.

                        Another pitfall is that sometimes unwanted content begins to wrap around a floated element. Removing an element from the 
                        flow of the document allows all the elements around the floated element to wrap and consume any available space around the 
                        floated element, which is often undesired. With our previous two-column example, after we floated the <section> and <aside> 
                        elements, and before we set a width property value on either of them, the content within the <footer> element would have 
                        wrapped in between the two floated elements above it, filling in any available space. Consequently, the <footer> element 
                        would have sat in the gutter between the <section> and <aside> elements, consuming the available space.

                    and they will be kind and lasting reward for them.
